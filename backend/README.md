# Backend Setup Issues

This document outlines the issues encountered while trying to set up the backend server.

## Python and Uvicorn Not Found

The primary issue is that the `python` and `uvicorn` executables are not in the system's PATH. This prevents the backend server from being started using the standard `uvicorn backend.server:app` command.

Several attempts were made to resolve this issue, including:

* Using `python -m uvicorn` and `python3 -m uvicorn`.
* Checking for the executables in common directories such as `/usr/bin`, `/bin`, and `/usr/local/bin`.
* Checking the system's `PATH` variable.

None of these attempts were successful.

## Docker Not Available

Docker is not available in this environment, which prevents the use of a Docker container to bypass the PATH issue.

## Next Steps

To resolve this issue, the next developer will need to investigate the environment to determine where the Python and Uvicorn executables are located. Once the executables are found, they can be added to the system's PATH or the backend can be started using the full path to the executable.
